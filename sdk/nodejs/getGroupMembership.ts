/**
 * ## # gitlab\_group\_membership
 *
 * Provides details about a list of group members in the gitlab provider. The results include id, username, name and more about the requested members.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * **By group's ID**
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gitlab from "@pulumi/gitlab";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(gitlab.getGroupMembership({
 *     groupId: 123,
 * }));
 * ```
 *
 * **By group's full path**
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gitlab from "@pulumi/gitlab";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(gitlab.getGroupMembership({
 *     fullPath: "foo/bar",
 * }));
 * ```
